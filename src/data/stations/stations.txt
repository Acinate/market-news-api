The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose around 250 points, or 1%, to end near 26,136, according to preliminary figures, while the S&P 500  advanced around 35 points, or 1.2%, to close near 2,924. The Nasdaq Composite  advanced around 107 points to end the day near 8,003, a gain of 1.4%. Analysts said trade concerns were soothed after the Commerce Department gave Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. another 90-day reprieve during which it can continue doing business with U.S. companies. Support was also tied to a move by the People's Bank of China to overhaul its interest-rate mechanism, which economists said would pave the way to lower borrowing costs for businesses. Also, Berlin indicated it was willing to employ fiscal stimulus if Germany's economy continues to slow.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

                  "content": "<p>Shares of Yuma Energy Inc.  rocketed nearly five-fold (up 366%) in very active afternoon trading Monday to bounce off a 40-year low, after the troubled Houston-based oil and natural gas exploration and production company reported audited second-quarter financial results, and said it has taken \"significant steps to arrest the recent declines\" of daily production. Trading volume topped 18 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 316,000 shares. The company had disclosed earlier a net loss that narrowed to $4.0 million, or $2.55 a share, from $4.4 million, or $2.86 a share, in the year-ago period. Sales of natural gas and crude oil dropped 71% to $1.67 million, as total production fell 68% to 53,873 barrels of oil equivalent. The company said it has \"substantial doubt\" in its ability to continue as a going concern for the 12 months following the release of results. Yuma said discussions regarding its restructuring and debt are \"ongoing,\" and management is \"hopeful\" that it can reach an accord with its lenders. The stock, which closed Friday at the lowest level since August 1979, has not gained 32% over the past year, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  has tumbled 20% and the S&P 500  has gained 2.7%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company fired its Chief Executive Peter Aceto for cause and pushed out President Eric Paul, after The Globe and Mail uncovered emails showing management were aware of the unlicensed grow and that some of the illicit cannabis had been exported to Denmark, a breach of Canadian drug laws.

Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One in Morristown, N.J., Trump said Cook argued that U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would give its rival, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.  , an advantage, since it would not be subject to the same restrictions as Apple. \"I thought he made a very compelling argument, so I'm thinking about it,\" Trump told reporters. Trump has threatened to impose 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods scheduled to begin in two stages, on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15. Apple shares are up 31% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's 15% gain.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
