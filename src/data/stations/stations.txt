The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee on Tuesday pegged July compliance with pledged output cuts at 159%, the highest monthly compliance rate so far this year. Meanwhile, a survey of analysts polled by S&P Global Platts shows expectations for a 4.7 million-barrel decline in last week's U.S. crude stocks, ahead of government supply data due Wednesday. Prospects for a deal to lift U.S. sanctions on Iran, which would add more barrels of oil to the market, also faded Tuesday, contributing to oil's rise. October West Texas Intermediate oil  rose $1.29, or 2.4%, to settle at $54.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Levandowski was accused by Alphabet of stealing technology when he was leader of its self-driving car unit Waymo and taking it with him when he moved to Uber. The parties reached a settlement in a civil suit in 2018, under which Uber promised not to use Waymo's technology and to give that company equity. Justice Department officials are to hold a press conference later to discuss the charges.

The all-important spread between the benchmark Italian bond and the comparable German maturity narrowed by 16 basis points to 1.83 percentage points. A narrower yield premium can indicate that investors see less geopolitical uncertainty on the horizon from Italy. Democratic Party Senate leader Andrea Marcucci said talks between the 5-Star and the center-left party had made progress. Tensions between the 5-Star Movement and the ascendant far-right League party had threatened to unleash political uncertainty into Italy.

One look at their marketing materials demonstrates just how egregious their sales tactics are - with flavors like cotton candy, gummy bear, unicorn, and graham cracker, they're clearly targeting young people.\" Separately, Philip Morris International Inc.  said it was in talks with Altria about a potential merger of equals.

                  "content": "<p>Shares of J.M. Smucker Co.  sank 4.4% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the branded pet and consumer foods and coffee company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that missed expectations, citing deflationary pricing in coffee and peanut butter and competitive activity in dog food, and lowered its full-year guidance. Net income for the quarter to July 31 rose to $154.6 million, or $1.36 a share, from $133.0 million, or $1.17 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $1.58, below the FactSet consensus of $1.74. Net sales fell 6% to $1.78 billion to miss the FactSet consensus of $1.87 billion. Within product segments, U.S. retail pet foods sales slipped 0.2% to $669.9 million to miss the FactSet consensus of $706.0 million; coffee sales declined 4.9% to $465.7 million, below expectations of $499.2 million; and consumer foods sales dropped 17% to $402.2 million, missing expectations of $403.6 million. For fiscal 2020, the company cut its guidance ranges for adjusted EPS to $8.35 to $8.55 from $8.45 to $8.65 and for sales growth to negative 1% to flat from up 1% to up 2%. The stock has lost 10.9% over the past three months through Monday, while the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector ETF  has gained 4.9% and the S&P 500  has tacked on 1.9%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

                  "content": "<p>WageWorks Inc.  said Tuesday it has received an unsolicited letter of interest from Mansa Parent Corp. that values the company at $58.58 a share.  The company said its board has reviewed the letter and unanimously concluded that it \"contains significant contingencies and is not reasonably expected to result in a superior proposal under the terms of WageWorks' previously announced merger with HealthEquity Inc. .\" The board further concluded that the offer \"does not constitute a true and serious proposal.\" The share price on offer is based on potential synergies of at least $110 million that would be generated from an acquisition by Mansa. The HealthEquity all-cash bid made in June values WageWorks at $51.35 per share, or a total enterprise value of about $2 billion. The all-cash offer represents a 28% premium to the volume weighted average closing price of WageWorks shares for the 30 trading days prior to HealthEquity's acquisition proposal becoming public on April 29, 2019. WageWorks is holding a special meeting on Aug. 28 to allow shareholders to vote on that bid. Shares were up 0.4% premarket but have gained 89% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 15%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
