The yield curve's slope is usually positive as investors demand more compensation to own long-term debt against inflationary pressures or monetary policy uncertainty. An inversion of the yield curve, or a negative yield spread, thus points to widening concerns about the health of the economy and is seen as an accurate recession indicator. Long-term government bonds have rallied in recent weeks, pushing their yields lower than their short-term peers, amid increasing signs that a trade deal between U.S. and China remain distant. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The all-important spread between the benchmark Italian bond and the comparable German maturity narrowed by 16 basis points to 1.83 percentage points. A narrower yield premium can indicate that investors see less geopolitical uncertainty on the horizon from Italy. Democratic Party Senate leader Andrea Marcucci said talks between the 5-Star and the center-left party had made progress. Tensions between the 5-Star Movement and the ascendant far-right League party had threatened to unleash political uncertainty into Italy. Analysts say Matteo Salvini, leader of the League party, was hoping to trigger a snap election, but Italian president Sergio Mattarella gave 5-Star the chance to form a new coalition. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

In May, Stein had filed suit against e-cigarette company Juul, which had received a $12.8 billion investment from cigarette seller Altria Group Inc.  in December. \"At the same time as our kids are headed off to school, we are hearing new stories about the health risks associated with e-cigarettes on a daily basis,\" said AG Josh Stein. \"Our complaints allege that these eight e-cig companies are helping to fuel an epidemic of vaping among high school and middle school students. One look at their marketing materials demonstrates just how egregious their sales tactics are - with flavors like cotton candy, gummy bear, unicorn, and graham cracker, they're clearly targeting young people.\" Separately, Philip Morris International Inc.  said it was in talks with Altria about a potential merger of equals.

                  "content": "<p>Shares of J.M. Smucker Co.  sank 4.4% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the branded pet and consumer foods and coffee company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that missed expectations, citing deflationary pricing in coffee and peanut butter and competitive activity in dog food, and lowered its full-year guidance. Net income for the quarter to July 31 rose to $154.6 million, or $1.36 a share, from $133.0 million, or $1.17 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $1.58, below the FactSet consensus of $1.74. Net sales fell 6% to $1.78 billion to miss the FactSet consensus of $1.87 billion. Within product segments, U.S. retail pet foods sales slipped 0.2% to $669.9 million to miss the FactSet consensus of $706.0 million; coffee sales declined 4.9% to $465.7 million, below expectations of $499.2 million; and consumer foods sales dropped 17% to $402.2 million, missing expectations of $403.6 million. For fiscal 2020, the company cut its guidance ranges for adjusted EPS to $8.35 to $8.55 from $8.45 to $8.65 and for sales growth to negative 1% to flat from up 1% to up 2%. The stock has lost 10.9% over the past three months through Monday, while the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector ETF  has gained 4.9% and the S&P 500  has tacked on 1.9%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

                  "content": "<p>WageWorks Inc.  said Tuesday it has received an unsolicited letter of interest from Mansa Parent Corp. that values the company at $58.58 a share.  The company said its board has reviewed the letter and unanimously concluded that it \"contains significant contingencies and is not reasonably expected to result in a superior proposal under the terms of WageWorks' previously announced merger with HealthEquity Inc. .\" The board further concluded that the offer \"does not constitute a true and serious proposal.\" The share price on offer is based on potential synergies of at least $110 million that would be generated from an acquisition by Mansa. The HealthEquity all-cash bid made in June values WageWorks at $51.35 per share, or a total enterprise value of about $2 billion. The all-cash offer represents a 28% premium to the volume weighted average closing price of WageWorks shares for the 30 trading days prior to HealthEquity's acquisition proposal becoming public on April 29, 2019. WageWorks is holding a special meeting on Aug. 28 to allow shareholders to vote on that bid. Shares were up 0.4% premarket but have gained 89% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 15%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

In addition to the financial settlement, the retailers are required to make reforms to their procedures. Dollar General agreed to stop selling obsolete motor oil and to pay $1.1 million in restitution, damages and penalties. Customers who bought the old motor oil can file a complaint online.
